description: How to change themes in fundset apps

Fundset is using shadcn/ui for the UI. Every shadcn tailwind V4 compatible theme will work in Fundset. Check out the [shadcn docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming) to see how to create a new theme.

## Extending the theme in runtime

Fundset base Payload CMS plugin is setting up a Theme [global config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/globals#global-configs) with `theme` field. You can store any CSS theme code there, which will then be injected to your website.

Check out [tweak.cn](https://tweakcn.com) to create a theme that suits your needs and then copy the CSS code and paste it into the `theme` field in the Theme global config.

You can edit this during runtime, either by editing the global config in the Payload dashboard or by using the payload API:

```ts
import payloadConfig from '@/payload.config';
import { getPayload } from 'payload';

const payload = await getPayload({
  config: payloadConfig,
});

await payload.updateGlobal({
  slug: 'theme',
  data: {
    theme: '...', // <--- your theme code here
  },
}),
```
