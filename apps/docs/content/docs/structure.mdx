## Repo structure

Fundset is a monorepo that is using pnpm. When you initialise your new project from a template you're gonna get `packages` directory that contains all the packages required for your settlement layer to work e.g for postgres you're gonna get `pg` package that contains a docker compose file so you can quickly run development script on your local machine. For EVM settlement layer, you're gonna a local instance of a blockchain to test your app on etc.

<Files>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="pg" />
    <Folder name="web" />
  </Folder>
  <File name="package.json" />
</Files>

The actual app is located under `packages/web` dir. There's a Next.js application with Payload CMS, shadcn/ui, Tanstack Query, next-intl and posthog.

## `_fundset` directory

Inside the `web` package, in the `src` dir, there's a `_fundset` folder.

<Files>
  <Folder name="web" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="_fundset" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="base-plugin"/> 
        <Folder name="config"/>
        <Folder name="settlement-layer"/>
        <Folder name="modules"/>
      </Folder>
    <Folder name="app"/>
    </Folder>

  </Folder>
  <File name="package.json" />
</Files>

### `_fundset` directory

`_fundset` directory contains all the files that are required for the template to work.

### `base-plugin`

`base-plugin` contains the base plugin for payload CMS that is used to create a base for a settlement layer.

### `config`

`config` is a directory that contains a helper for getting the settlement layer on the server side.

### `settlement-layer`

`settlement-layer` is the most important directory as it contains the base logic to use a given settlement layer as well as the actual settlement layers that are installed into your project.

### `modules`

`modules` directory contains modules, which are separate, standalone pieces of functionality in the application. Modules are implemented per settlement layer as each has different setups, prerequisites and configurations.
