Fundset Plugins are basically Payload CMS plugins. They are used to extend payload CMS's collections, global configs, add custom functionality etc.

Fundset comes with a base plugin that is used to store data about the chosen settlement layer. Each settlement layer has its own plugin that is used to store data about it and to allow the admin to configure all the settings.

You can read more about them in the [Payload CMS docs](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/overview).
